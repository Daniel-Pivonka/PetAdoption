This mini project essentially functions as a favorites activity.

Clicking "Favorites" will show all your favorite pets currently in the database
in a ListView.

Clicking "Add husky" will add a male Siberian Husky to the database. Multiple
clicks will add multiple huskies

To delete an item from the database, hold down the item you wish to delete, and
you will get the option to delete pet. The pet will be deleted from the
database, and the view will be updated.
